#Topology:

## **Peer-to-Peer Configuration**

* In a peer-to-peer distributed system, applications can use GemFire 'mirroring' to replicate the data to other
nodes or to partition large volumes of data across multiple nodes.

* In this cache configuration, the cache is maintained locally in each peer application
and shares the cache space with the application memory space.
